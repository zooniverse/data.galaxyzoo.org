Description: Morphological classifications of galaxies from Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS

             This table includes all 49,555 galaxies included in GZC, which had M_H <= 25.5
             and were selected from the COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS fields.  Morphological
             classifications include both unweighted and weighted versions of the vote
             fractions of the responses to each task, as well as the total count and weighted
             count of votes for each task. The final five columns give boolean flags for
             galaxies in various "clean" morphological samples (see Table 3 in paper).

             This paper includes the release of the raw and weighted classifications for each
             of the 49,555 subjects in the Galaxy Zoo CANDELS sample. In addition to each raw
             and weighted vote fraction for each task, we include the raw and weighted number
             of answers to each task, as well as the total raw and weighted classifier count
             for each subject. This combines for a total of 136 quantities for each subject,
             not including the subject ID or any other metadata. The structure of the data for
             each task number NN with i = 0 to n−1 responses is as follows:
             
             t[NN]_[quest abbrev]_a[i]_[resp abbrev]_frac : the raw fraction of classifiers 
                who gave this response.  quest abbrev and resp abbrev are abbreviated versions
                of the specific question and response, respectively.

             t[NN]_[quest abbrev]_a[i]_[resp abbrev]_weighted_frac : the weighted fraction of
                classifiers who gave this response.

             t[NN]_[quest abbrev]_count : the raw count of classifiers who responded to this task.

             t[NN]_[quest abbrev]_weight : the weighted count of classifiers who responded to this task.
