Description: Morphological classifications of main-sample spectroscopic galaxies from Galaxy Zoo 2

This table includes galaxies with spectra in SDSS Data Release 7. Several columns give data that can be used to cross-match rows with other SDSS tables, including objIDs and positions of the galaxies. Morphological classifications include six parameters for each category: unweighted and weighted versions of both the total number of votes and the vote fraction for that response, the vote fraction after being debiased, and flags for systems identified as being in clean samples.

Note that this table and dr10_gz2_stripe82_normal contain some of the same galaxies (with r < 17.0).
